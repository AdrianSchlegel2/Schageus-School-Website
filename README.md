# Schageus-School-Website
A Website I created as a school project about my school (in german). The task was mainly to program a future plan for our school
as a smart school using css and html. 
Therefore, the first index html site (with the cookies) and generally everything else is without js. 

To correctly use the website you have to "accept" the cookies in the index page (they do not have actual javascript behind it.)

Here is the domain created by github: https://schageus.github.io/Schageus-School-Website/
