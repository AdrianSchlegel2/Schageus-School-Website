# Schageus-School-Website
A Website I created as a school project about my school (in german). The task was mainly to program a website using css and html. 
Therefore, the first html site (with the cookies) is without js. 

To correctly use the website you have to "accept" the cookies in the index page (they do not have actual javascript behind it.)

Here is the domain created by github: https://schageus.github.io/Schageus-School-Website/
